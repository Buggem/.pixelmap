# .pixelmap


## VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

FIRST, the word Pixelmap is way too commonly spoke of.

SECOND, we're rebranding the whole thing. Big pain in the ass, I know,

but we're moving to the new future of .nip. Yep. .NIP.

.NIP sounds like nip as in bite but it stands for:

New Image Protocol

However there will be not at all any new pieces to code and the Pikachu Pixelmap example.

JK, we won't be doing anything here :) lol.

But either be clear with .PIXELMAP not Pixelmap or call it NIP.

and don't confuse it with this search result either: https://github.com/matteliot/PixelMap.

There are way too many Pixelmaps.

I can't think why I even called it that.

Oh well, I think we'll just have to live with it.

## Disclaimer
This has absoulutly no invovlvement with the crypto project `Pixelmap`. If you want that [search for it](https://github.com/search?q=pixelmap), don't come here.

This disclaimer may make you suspicious but it's really just to avoid traffic from other projects.

## Now, back to diving in!
<br>
.PIXELMAP files are images readable in JSON form. Simillar to SVG, .PIXELMAPs are editable human readable JSON files. 
<br>
Here is the source for our render APIs and the expected .PIXELMAP syntax.
<!-- Wouldn't it be nice to add more info -->
The main example for Pixelmap is https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1616444. See more APIs and documentation <a href="https://github.com/Nyanport/.pixelmap/blob/main/renderers/README.md">here</a>.
